## About

The SwiftUI framework was unveiled in 2019 and in just a few years has proven to be impactful in the developer community. 
Soon it will be a common requirement to integrate the new SwiftUI app functionality with the existing project codebase. Fortunately, this integration can be achieved easily using ContainerViews and UIHostingControllers.

You should have some preliminary knowledge about UIKit to be able to go through this activity.
